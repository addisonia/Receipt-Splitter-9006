        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no
    - have a switch button so user can choose between 
    proportional tax and even split tax
    - have a save option (to like csv or something)


- use firebase cloud storage (spark plan) to save data

- create a login button where users can create an
account to save receipt data
