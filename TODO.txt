- split tax evenly among all buyers when there are no
items entered yet

- add "Enter a buyer" in faded text in the text box
for Buyers and have it go away after the first buyer
is entered

- Settings button
    - Accessibility ideas within settings:
        - dark mode option
        - alternating white and light gray background color 
        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no
    - have a switch button so user can choose between 
    proportional tax and even split tax
    - have a save option (to like csv or something)


- have it save the split data when you go to the home screen
(use local storage method for now)
- add a reset/clear button to split page

OTHER IDEAS:
------------------------------

- use firebase cloud storage (spark plan) to save data

-add remove item button (trash can symbol?)

- create a login button where users can create an
account to save receipt data



Machine learning related ideas:
- dont tax food items
(maybe put "tax" in front of the item)
(machine learning food or not food model??)
- vegan option
(type VEGAN at end of buyer name to auto uncheck non 
vegan items)


- different views for different reported screen sizes 
(mobile view) use react??


- weighted items option?

- multiple of same items option (automath?)



- for home page: when spacebar is pressed go to split page



- add snake game
