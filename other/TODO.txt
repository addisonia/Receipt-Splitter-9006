        - alternating white and light gray background color 
        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no

- ability to sign in with email and password as well
instead of just google sign in

- allow users to delete past receipts


Machine learning related ideas:

(maybe put "tax" in front of the item)
(machine learning food or not food model??)

(type VEGAN at end of buyer name to auto uncheck non 
vegan items)



- for snake game, replace snake pixel with Receipt
png ðŸ“œ and add bent receipts for when the snake turns
- use coins or moneybag png for snake food


- weighted items option?

- allow users to import past receipts directly
into display grid



- notes page
