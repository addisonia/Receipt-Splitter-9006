BUGS:
------------------------------

- none


------------------------------
TO ADD:
------------------------------

- add a column to the far right called Per item
that has one checkbox (default unchecked). if
checked change the checkboxes in the buyers row for
that item to be number inputs (default to even split)
and have some way to prevent if numbers dont add up
to total cost


- add price totals for all buyers below items for each
receipt on my receipts page


- make down key go from buyers to tax when in mobile view

------------------------------
OTHER IDEAS:
------------------------------

- add game mode Paradise where food covers the entire
game board, snake increases by 1 for each food

- add game mode "Free Range" where when the snake hits
a wall it travels through it to the opposite side

-add remove item button (trash can symbol? x circle symbol?)

- unselect all items from a user option

- make the high score on snake game reflect high score
for each game mode

- Settings button additions
    - Accessibility ideas within settings:
        - less dark mode
        - alternating white and light gray background color 
        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no

- ability to sign in with email and password as well
instead of just google sign in

- allow users to delete past receipts

- download button on My Receipts page to download data as csv

Machine learning related ideas:
- dont tax food items
(maybe put "tax" in front of the item)
(machine learning food or not food model??)
- vegan option
(type VEGAN at end of buyer name to auto uncheck non 
vegan items)



- for snake game, replace snake pixel with Receipt
png ðŸ“œ and add bent receipts for when the snake turns
- use coins or moneybag png for snake food


- weighted items option?

- allow users to import past receipts directly
into display grid



- notes page

- weather page
