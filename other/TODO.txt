    - Accessibility ideas within settings:
        - alternating white and light gray background color 
        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no


Machine learning related ideas:
- dont tax food items
(maybe put "tax" in front of the item)
(machine learning food or not food model??)

(type VEGAN at end of buyer name to auto uncheck non 
vegan items)


- reorganize receipt splitter split page for mobile
view


- weighted items option?

- multiple of same items option (automath?)
