    - Accessibility ideas within settings:
        - alternating white and light gray background color 
        on display grid for ease of seeing?
        - for buyer name checkbox maybe do a green fill 
        square around name to indicate yes for item and when 
        clicked turn red to indicate no
    - have a switch button so user can choose between 
    proportional tax and even split tax


- create a login button where users can create an
account to save receipt data (on firebase cloud)

- have a user profile icon that appears only after 
a user has signed in. they can click on this icon
to access past saved receipts and whatnot

- have a Save button that appears after a user has
signed in, which they can click to save data to their
account



- when google search console finishes indexing add 
sitemap (https://addisonia.github.io/Receipt-Splitter-9006/sitemap.xml)

(mobile view) use react??
